At the time of writing, my research involves examining data science code written in Python to gain insights into the common practices that data scientists follow when naming identifiers. Identifiers refer to the unique lexical tokens found within code, which include names for classes, methods, variables, arguments, and more. In particular, I am working with the use of abbreviations and acronyms in identifier naming. Identifier names are important because they help programmers to understand the code's functionality.

Conducting a research project definitely helped improve my communication skills. Regular interactions with my faculty mentor are crucial for success, and I have learned to convey my ideas and progress to ensure that we are always on the same page. I also learned the importance of conducting literature reviews to analyze existing research and identify knowledge gaps. Additionally, doing research has improved my time management skills, which will definitely benefit my academic and professional career. I have to balance the tasks of the research project alongside my regular schoolwork, which is not always easy.

I highly recommend that students apply for the various UROP funding opportunities. Conducting research is a really rewarding experience for students across all disciplines. It not only enhances academic knowledge but also provides valuable skills and insights that extend beyond the classroom. My most important piece of advice for any student considering applying for UROP to maintain constant communication with their advisor. Building a strong relationship with the advisor is crucial for guidance and support throughout the research process. Additionally, it is essential to start working on the applications well ahead of the due dates. This ensures ample time for planning, refining research proposals, and addressing any potential challenges that may arise during the application process.
