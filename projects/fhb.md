During my First Hawaiian Bank summer software engineering internship, I played a role in enhancing the internal-facing web pages by establishing a unified visual identity using HTML and CSS. This involved aligning the design elements with the company's brand theme to create a cohesive and professional look. Additionally, I focused on implementing responsive design principles to ensure a seamless viewing experience across various devices and browsers. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to publicly display the work that I accomplished at FHB. This experience allowed me to contribute directly to the overall user experience and the company's commitment to maintaining a consistent visual presence.

In my role, I took on significant responsibilities and actively participated in the team's bi-weekly sprints. Demonstrating effective task management, I achieved a 100% completion rate of assigned Jira tickets, showcasing my commitment to meeting project objectives and adhering to timelines. Engaging in daily stand-up meetings, I provided comprehensive progress reports within the Agile framework, fostering effective communication within the team. Furthermore, my involvement in sprint retrospectives allowed me to contribute valuable insights and suggestions for process improvement, reinforcing my dedication to continuous learning and refinement of development practices.

Throughout this internship, I gained invaluable insights into software engineering practices and project management. The experience enhanced my technical skills, particularly in HTML and CSS, and deepened my understanding of responsive design principles. Beyond technical skills, I developed effective communication and collaboration skills through daily stand-ups and active participation in team discussions. Contributing to sprint retrospectives allowed me to reflect on the iterative development process and provided me with a foundation for suggesting improvements. Overall, this internship not only expanded my technical toolkit but also equipped me with essential soft skills for thriving in a collaborative work environment.
